# Taste the Nash
This project was intended to be a way for Vanderbilt students to efficiently discover restaurants on their meal plan, as well as leave recommendations for their favorite menu items. Taste of Nashville is the name of the partnership between Vanderbilt and nearby restaurants that allows students to spend money from their meal plan at outside restaurants.
